Hi, my name is Illy!
- 📚 I am currently in my fourth year of undergrad at the University of Connecticut pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in computational data analytics and a minor in Mathematics. 
- 📁 I am currently employed as a Software Engineering intern at Savant Systems as well as a student teaching assistant for the CS department at UConn.
- 🫰 As for hobbies, I run and play pickle ball recreationally, love to listen to RnB and hip-hop, and binging today's trending shows and movies -- I am anticipating s5 of Prime's The Boys!
- 🥅 I am currently in the process of applying to graduate school programs to advance my education in Computer Science. I am also applying to possible research/intern opportunities for Summer 2025!
