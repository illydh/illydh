Hi, my name is Illy!
- 📚 I am currently in my third year the University of Connecticut pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a concentration in computational data analytics as well as an additional degree in Applied Math. 
- 📁 I am currently employed as a student teaching assistant for the CS department at UConn as well as a student web developer at UConn's communication department.
- 🫰 As for hobbies, I am running recreationally, learning how to box (the sweet science), listening to RnB and hip-hop, and binging today's trending shows and movies.
- 🥅 This upcoming Spring semester, I am anticipating a research position in Machine Learning with Dr. Suining He. As for the summer, I am excited to be joining the InStep team at Infosys on collaborative projects as an intern.
